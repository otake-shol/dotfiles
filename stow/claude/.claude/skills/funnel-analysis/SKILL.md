# Funnel Analysis & CRO

Conversion funnel audit framework with psychology-based optimization.

## When to Use

- User wants to improve conversion rates on a page or flow
- User has analytics data showing drop-off at specific steps
- User is designing a landing page, signup flow, or checkout
- User asks about A/B testing priorities or CRO strategy

## Funnel Audit: 5-Step Process

### Step 1: Map the Funnel
Define each stage and its expected conversion rate:
```
Visit → Interest → Consideration → Action → Retention
  100%    60%        30%            10%       5%
```

### Step 2: Identify Drop-Off Points
For each stage transition, ask:
- What is the current conversion rate?
- What is the benchmark for this industry?
- What friction exists at this transition?

### Step 3: Diagnose with Psychology Principles

| Principle | Application | Common Fix |
|-----------|------------|------------|
| Cognitive Load | Too many choices paralyze | Reduce form fields, simplify options |
| Loss Aversion | Fear of losing > desire to gain | "Don't miss out" > "Get started" |
| Social Proof | People follow others | Add testimonials, user counts, logos |
| Anchoring | First number sets expectation | Show original price before discount |
| Reciprocity | Give before asking | Free trial, free resource, value first |
| Urgency/Scarcity | Limited availability drives action | "3 spots left", countdown timers |
| Trust Signals | Reduce perceived risk | Guarantees, security badges, reviews |
| Commitment | Small yes leads to big yes | Micro-conversions before purchase |

### Step 4: Prioritize with ICE Scoring

Rate each optimization idea 1-10:

| Factor | Question |
|--------|----------|
| **I**mpact | How much will this move the metric? |
| **C**onfidence | How sure are we this will work? |
| **E**ase | How easy is this to implement? |

**ICE Score = (I + C + E) / 3** → Rank and execute top items first.

### Step 5: Test & Measure
- A/B test one variable at a time
- Run for at least 2 weeks or 1000 visitors per variant
- Track micro-conversions (scroll, click, hover) not just macro
- Document results for compounding knowledge

## Quick Wins Checklist

- [ ] Clear, benefit-focused headline (not feature-focused)
- [ ] Single primary CTA above the fold
- [ ] Social proof within viewport (testimonials, logos, numbers)
- [ ] Reduce form fields to absolute minimum
- [ ] Add trust signals near payment/action areas
- [ ] Mobile-optimized (thumb-friendly tap targets)
- [ ] Page load under 3 seconds

## Common Mistakes

- **Testing too many variables**: One change per test, otherwise you can't attribute results
- **Stopping tests early**: Statistical significance requires adequate sample size
- **Optimizing vanity metrics**: Focus on revenue, not just click-through rates
- **Ignoring mobile**: Most traffic is mobile; desktop-only optimization misses the majority
